            <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. Landfills collect <br>
               garbage and other land pollution in a central location. Many places are running out of <br>
               space for landfills.</p>

                <p>Water is one of the basic necessities of life. Though about three-fourths of the Earth surface covers with water bodies, but the availability of fresh water to us is of a serious issue. Water pollution is another main type of pollution. It gets polluted when harmful substances enter the water bodies or seep down the water table. It has the unique feature of dissolving many substances. Dissolved gases like oxygen are essential for aquatic life.</p>

                <p>Among the many other types of pollution, soil pollution or land pollution is the next one. Soil is one of the important natural resources. The soil provides shelter to many animals and supports the growth of plants from which we obtain our basic needs. Soil also gets harmful and polluted when some harmful substances mix with the soil.</p>
